# FSDI 114 - Algorithms & Data Structures

This repository presents some exercises for designing algorithms and data structures in Python.

It presents elementary data structures, sorting and searching algorithms which will be used for designing various efficient algorithms.

## Assignment 1 - Anagram Check

Design a function called "anagram_check" which takes two strings as parameters, the function should return **True** if the two strings are anagrams, otherwise **False**.

An anagram is the rearrangement of a word or sentence into another, using only the same characters.

## Assignment 2 - Queue Class

Implement a Queue class from scratch using the Node class that was made, be sure to implement the essential *enqueue* and *dequeue* functions. You can also implement a *size* and *is_empty* functions.

## Assignment 3 - Stacks and Queues

### Stack

Implement a Stack class that allows you to:

1. Check if it is empty
2. Push a new item
3. Pop an item
4. Peek at the top item
5. Return the size

### Queue

Implement a Queue class that allows you to:

1. Check if the queue is empty
2. Enqueue (add a new item)
3. Dequeue (remove an item)
4. Return the size of the queue
